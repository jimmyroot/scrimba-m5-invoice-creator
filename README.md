# Scrimba Frontend Dev Path — Module 5 — Solo Project — Invoice Creator

## A simple invoice creator built with HTML, CSS, JavaScrript, Firebase Realtime DB

Features include the following...
- Create and send a new invoice
- Invoice history stored in database
- Abilty to retrieve/view a single invoice previously saved in the database
- Light / dark mode implemented, preferences saved in database
- Fully modularised (it's a word?), with code organised according to functional groups

## What did I learn
My mains takeaways from this project were 
- Code modularisation
- Performing single reads from a firebase backend with 'get'
- Lots of new CSS tricks mostly around use of modals

## Other thoughts
For this project I focussed quite heavily on modularising the code. Unfortunately I wrote
all the code first and then tried to separate it out, which I think has ended up with 
a messier project than I would of liked. Still pleased with the overall result, however :-)
